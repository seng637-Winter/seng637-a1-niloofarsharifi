# Introduction


In this Lab we will try to make the first bug report for the SUT, here being the ATM application. This bug report will consist on 2 aproaches or techniques.

Exploratory: a more informal and unscripted approach that emphasizes the tester's freedom and creativity. Testers dynamically devise and execute tests based on their understanding of the application's behavior.  
Manual Scripted: a structured approach where testers follow a predefined set of test cases to verify the functionality of an application. The tests are scripted, specifying the steps to be taken, the expected results, and the actual outcomes. It's methodical and repeatable, ensuring that the application works as intended in expected use-case scenarios.
    
None of our groups' members have prior experience with testing. But our understanding of exploratory testing, was testing the SUT with no pre-defined structure and plan and as the name suggests, exploring different functionalities of the SUT on a trial and error basis. And what we assumed about the scripted testing, was scenario-based testing with pre-defined scenarios and plans that a person with background knowledge has prepared. 

In this report, we have recorded exploratory testing results as well as MFT using Azure bug tracking tool for both versions of the SUT (ATM application).

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

Exploratory Testing is good at finding problems that aren't usually expected during normal use. How well exploratory testing works depends a lot on the tester's knowledge of the System Under Test (SUT). If the tester knows the SUT's functional needs and what should happen, they can explore unusual scenarios that might reveal issues. In our exploratory testing, we made sure to use all the main features like Deposit, Withdrawal, Transfer, and Balance Inquiry and also tried to find unusual cases. For example, we tried to enter a very long PIN code for the card ans system didn't throw eny errors; or interface glitches or wrong spellings('wood' nstead of would); these are rare cases that a Manual Functional Test (MFT) might not cover. Exploratory testing is great for coming up with creative tests that would be hard to plan for in MFT. Basically, exploratory testing can find unexpected problems, but how well it works really depends on the tester's knowledge of the app and the quality of the test plan. The best person to do ET or make the test plan is someone who really knows what the app should do. Also, how much time you have for testing affects exploratory testing; in our lab, we only had 30 minutes, which led to finding about 15-20 issues. More time could mean finding more problems.

On the other hand, Manual Functional Testing (MFT) is a more organized way of testing and works well for checking the usual ways of using the SUT. MFT is a step-by-step process with all the tests already set out. The depth of these tests decides how good MFT is. In the lab, the tests in Appendix C were basic and didn't look for unusual cases, which means we didn't use MFT to its full potential. A big plus of MFT, compared to exploratory testing, is that the tester doesn't need to know a lot about the SUT because they just follow the steps, which makes the process faster. In the end, how good MFT is will really depend on how well the tests are written.

In conclusion, exploratory testing and MFT both have their pros and cons, exploratory testing is better at identifying uncommon use cases, while MFT is very effective at uncovering the common use cases. Exploratory testing lacks efficency in the sense that the tester has to have an in-depth understand of the SUT before testing and has time limits for testing. On the other hand, MFT depends on how well the test cases are written and does not require the background knowledge of the system for the tester. Therefore, MFT can be more efficent in terms of how many use cases are tested. Overall, both scenarios are required when dealing with testing a system: The developers of the SUT would perform a preliminary exploratory testing, then afterwards the MFT can be done by a tester who doesnt necessarily have a great understanding of the SUT.
